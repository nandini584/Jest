Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

This is the first time I am learning Jest but I wanted to create a game for everyone to get familiar with Jest and get to learn easily. This would be my long projecta and I will keep on working on it although I have no fucking idea what I am gonna build. But WHO CARES?? ;)

1. Install the above dependency in your code
``` npm install --save-dev jest ```

2. Add ``` "test": "jest --coverage" ``` to get the full testing information.
That's it for now Happy Coding!!
